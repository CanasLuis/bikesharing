##Purpose of the analysis
This analysis is being made to understand how the bike rides work in NeW York City so we can understand theh bussiness and convince the investors to help us with our own bike share business, we can get to know better the trip durations, in that time of the day and week the people prefer to go for a ride and also the zones they prefer to be. It is very important to analyze the business before making any type of decisions and we can see if it would be realiable in the future. 

##Results
When we work we the data, we can see the peak hours for bike riding in the city, either in the morning or in the afternoon, as follows:

in addition, we can see that the most rides occurr at the city center, this may suggest that we have to concentrate the bigger amount of bikes here:

with the previous 2 images, we can set our strategy focusing on certain things like number of bikes available, workers needed at each places and hours of the day, etc. 

Furthermore, we can see the tripduration by hour of the day and also by gender, this help us to see what kind of clients we have the most and define our strategies, for example, we can see that men are taking longer trips than women, we can investigate deeper to understand the main reason of that and try to make marketing in order to have more women and families as our clients.

If we take a look at the weekdays, we can see more activity during Thursdays, also, on Saturday we have almost all day with considerable amount of clients:

Finally, the subscribers take more rides than normal customers, except for "unknown" sex types, so we have a very good detail of the clients we have, that can lead to planification and improvements since we have information from our main clients.

##Summary
